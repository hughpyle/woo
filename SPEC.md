# woo — specification

Programmable persistent objects, single-parent inheritance, modernized types, structured event messaging. A globally distributed successor to LambdaMOO. v1 runs on a single machine or a single vendor's edge (Cloudflare); cross-operator federation is reserved for v2.

> Status: working draft. Section numbers in headers are stable references for conversation.

## 1. Vision

**woo** is a multi-user, persistent, programmable world. Every object is independently addressable and stateful. Users (human or agent) connect over websockets, inhabit a player object, and interact by emitting events and invoking verbs on other objects. Objects can be edited and reprogrammed at runtime by sufficiently privileged users; all code is sandboxed in a custom bytecode VM with tick metering and per-task memory caps.

The system is **globally distributed** — every object is its own actor, hosted at the edge, with no single process or node carrying the whole world. v1 runs within one vendor's namespace. Cross-operator federation (the broader sense of "decentralized") is designed but deferred to v2.

The system is **infrastructure, not UI**. The chat-text interface is one renderer. The wire protocol is structured events. Browser-hosted "transient" objects participate in the same execution model as server-hosted persistent ones.

## 2. Concepts and terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Object** | A persistent, individually addressable entity. Holds properties, verbs, location, parent, owner. |
| **Persistent object** | Server-hosted; one persistent host per woo object. Identifier prefix `#`. |
| **Transient object** | Client-hosted (typically browser); lifetime bounded by the connection. Identifier prefix `~`. |
| **Verb** | Callable code attached to an object. Dispatched by name through the standard lookup rule: parent chain, then feature lookup where applicable. |
| **Property** | Named slot on an object. *Defined* on an ancestor (with default + perms); *value* per object. |
| **Player** | An object that has an attached client connection. Just an object, not a separate type. |
| **Task** (VM) | A serializable activation stack; the unit of execution. Migrates between hosts on verb dispatch. Also called a *VM activation* when distinguishing from a taskspace's work-item "task" (see `spec/taskspace-demo.md`). |
| **Host** | Anything that can run a VM: an edge worker, a persistent host, or a transient host. |
| **Event** / **Observation** | A structured map (`{type, ...}`) emitted from one object to one or more listeners. The two terms are synonyms: `core.md` says "observation" to distinguish from messages and mutations; `events.md` and the wire/API say "event" by historical naming. |
| **Renderer** | Code that turns events into a presentation. Usually a transient object. |
| **Wizard** | A flag on an object granting elevated permissions. |

## Profiles

Spec scope is organized into four progressive profiles. See [profiles.md](spec/profiles.md) for the per-doc map.

| Profile | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **first-light** | Runnable dubspace + taskspace demos, minimal IDE, local dev runtime; T0 fixtures plus v0.5 VM/persistence slices | reference impl in `src/` (v0.5 local; not a v1-core claim) |
| **v1-core** | Full semantics + protocol + Cloudflare reference; durable, multi-actor, recoverable | spec ready; impl partial |
| **v1-ops** | Worktrees, migrations, backups, deployments, observability, debugging, teams, credentialed auth, catalogs, conformance | spec ready |
| **v2-federation** | Cross-world calls (mTLS), peer trust, federated identity | reserved; designs in `spec/deferred/` |

Each profile is a superset of the one above.

## Layers

The spec is split into layers, mostly orthogonal to profiles. Implementation references in semantics and protocol layers are explicit pointers to reference; you can read semantics + protocol without committing to Cloudflare.

| Path | Layer | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| [spec/semantics/](spec/semantics/) | **semantics** | Language and object model. Implementation-neutral. |
| [spec/protocol/](spec/protocol/) | **protocol** | Host classes, wire format, browser bootstrap. |
| [spec/reference/](spec/reference/) | **reference** | Concrete Cloudflare mapping. v1 only. |
| [spec/deferred/](spec/deferred/) | **deferred** | Not in v1. Federation, capabilities, audio. |

For what is *currently built* (as opposed to what the spec is building toward), see the implementation snapshots in [`notes/`](notes/). The current cut is documented in [notes/impl-v0.5-rich-vm-persistence-compiler.md](notes/impl-v0.5-rich-vm-persistence-compiler.md); the older [notes/impl-v0-first-light.md](notes/impl-v0-first-light.md) is historical. Current debt and spec/impl drift is in [TECH_DEBT_AUDIT.md](TECH_DEBT_AUDIT.md).

Loose docs alongside the spec layers:

- [spec/dubspace-demo.md](spec/dubspace-demo.md), [spec/taskspace-demo.md](spec/taskspace-demo.md), [spec/chat-demo.md](spec/chat-demo.md) — demo surface specs (what each demo provides; first-light profile).
